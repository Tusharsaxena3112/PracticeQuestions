/*You recently visited a car showroom in your locality.
 You finally selected a car named ‘X’ from a company named ‘Y’.
 The salesperson from the showroom told you about two variants of the car, one was with a CNG/Petrol fuel engine and the other was simply a Petrol fuel engine.
 The one variant with the CNG version is more fuel-efficient than the other but obviously costs more due to the added CNG configuration.
 You know the price and fuel efficiency (in kilometres per litre, kmpl for short) of both cars.
 You plan to keep the car for a period of 10 years.
 Assume the price ₹80 per litre of Petrol and ₹50 per kg for CNG and usage of about 15,000 kilometres per year.
 You will pay cash for the car and do not worry about financing costs.
 Which car is the better deal? Write a class named ‘CarComparator.java’ to emulate this program in Java.
